What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
- merge in git allows for the source branch to be merged or integrated/combined
with a target branch by taking the contents of the branch and combining/integrating
it with the target branch creating a new merge commit. In short, merging refers to
the process of combining different branches into a single branch on a repository.
On the other hand, rebase allows one to update the start of a branch to a later/recent
commit that occured after the user branched out. In summary, the rebase takes changes
in the feature branches and updates the start of another branch. The difference between
merge and rebase is that the merge is non-linear in terms of the history of both branches
as the history of both the branches is maintained as-is. The rebase maintains the linear
branch history by moving the branch to a new base commit at the start.
