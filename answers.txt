What is a remote repository?
A remote repository is a single central online repository
that is seen and accessed by different project collaborators.
The remote repository also has a versioning history similiar
to that of a local repository. A remote repository is a project
version that is hosted on an online database / network location
that allows for project collaborators to access a shared
repository from different places. Therefore the remote
repository acts as a centralized storage server space for the
codebase facilitating collaboration and backups of the project
stable version information that is a tracked location for code.
